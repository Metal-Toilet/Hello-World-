    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <h2>We don't ask much just the following...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting,
        sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
      </li>
      <li>
        No self-promotion(server invites, advertisements, etc.) without
        permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spamming or mass mentioning - by sending repetitive messages, emojis,
        images, reactions, mass mentioning, or mentioning for no reason - is not
        tolerated in this server or DMs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any harmful material (viruses, phishing, pornographic images/links,
        links to Discord servers that involve the aforementioned, etc.) will
        result in immediate punishment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inappropriate language (excessive swears, racial slurs, deliberate
        attempts to instigate negative reactions, etc.) will be removed and the
        user(s) in questions will be given a warning, be timed out, kicked, or
        banned depending on the severity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Names should be Latin characters and numbers only (A-Z / 0-9). They
        should not contain Zalgo, blank names, unusual Unicode, political views,
        attention-seeking names, overly lengthy names, slurs, or other offensive
        material. Violating names will be changed.
      </li>
      <li>Follow the Discord Terms of Service and Guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These rules are not meant to be exhaustive, and we reserve the right to
      determine what conduct we consider to be a violation of the Rules and to
      take action. <br />
      <br />
      Reaching 3 warns will result in an auto-kick. To report a message react
      with ⚠️ on the message. To appeal a punishment DM a Senior Moderator. For
      more info read the info channel in the discord.
